title: "Urban Navigation on Autopilot"
excerpt: "The system integrates multi-sensor perception, BEV-based scene representation, dynamic object tracking, and decision-making to handle complex mixed-traffic scenarios, including dense pedestrians, cyclists, and unstructured road interactions. It enables safe, smooth, and reliable autonomous driving in challenging city conditions, demonstrating production-ready performance for urban deployment.<br/><br/><video style='max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;' controls><source src='https://yueyeyuniao.github.io/files/turtlebot_2x.mp4' type='video/mp4'> Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>"

Our team explored the use of MATLAB to control a TurtleBot to perform path planning and obstacle avoidance autonomously in a given environment with a known map. To complete this goal, this project is divided in six parts: map acquiring, image processing, path planning, path following, map updating and obstacle avoidance.
