Hello, I am Peng Chang, currently serving as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [Yeloworld](https://www.yeloworld.com/en/), where I lead the company’s technology strategy and R&D efforts in robotics and autonomous systems.<br>
<br>
I received my Ph.D. from Northeastern University in 2021 and conducted my doctoral research at the [Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles Research (RIVeR) Lab](http://robot.neu.edu/), led by Prof. Taskin Padir. My research focused on model-based manipulation of deformable linear objects, task automation in both simulation and real-world environments, and shared control for human–robot collaboration.<br>
<br>
Prior to joining Yeloworld, I worked as a Tech Lead at [Black Sesame Technologies](https://www.blacksesame.com/en), where I focused on autonomous perception solutions for intelligent driving systems, contributing to the development and deployment of production-level perception pipelines.<br>
